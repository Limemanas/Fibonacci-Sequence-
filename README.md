# Fibonacci Suite (C)

This repository contains a simple C program for generating Fibonacci numbers using recursion.

## Description

The Fibonacci suite in C utilizes recursion to generate Fibonacci numbers efficiently. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This suite provides a recursive implementation in C to generate Fibonacci sequences, making use of the mathematical definition of Fibonacci numbers.

Recursion is a powerful concept in computer science where a function calls itself to solve a problem. In this suite, recursion is employed to efficiently compute Fibonacci numbers by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.

The code is designed to be simple and easy to understand, providing a basic implementation of the Fibonacci sequence generation in C.

## Usage

Simply compile the provided C file (`fibonacci.c`) and run the executable. You'll be prompted to enter the value of 'n', and the program will display the nth Fibonacci number.
